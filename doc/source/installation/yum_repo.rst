 Percona :program:`yum` Repository
===================================

The |Percona| :program:`yum` repository supports popular *RPM*-based operating systems, including the *Amazon Linux AMI*.

The easiest way to install the *Percona Yum* repository is to install an *RPM* that configures :program:`yum` and installs the `Percona GPG key <http://www.percona.com/downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-percona>`_. You can also do the installation manually.

Automatic Installation
======================

Execute the following command as a ``root`` user, replacing ``x86_64`` with ``i386`` if you are not running a 64-bit operating system: ::

  $ yum install http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-release/percona-release-0.0-1.x86_64.rpm

You should see some output such as the following: ::

  Retrieving http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-release/percona-release-0.0-1.x86_64.rpm
  Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
     1:percona-release        ########################################### [100%]

The RPMs for the automatic installation are available at http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-release/ and include source code.

Manual Installation
===================

To install the repository manually, place the following into a new file named :file:`/etc/yum.repos.d/Percona.repo`: ::

  [percona]
  name = CentOS $releasever - Percona
  baseurl=http://repo.percona.com/centos/$releasever/os/$basearch/
  enabled = 1
  gpgkey = file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-percona
  gpgcheck = 1

Also, copy the `Percona GPG key <http://www.percona.com/downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-percona>`_  into a file named :file:`/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-percona`.

Testing The Repository
======================

Make sure packages are downloaded from the repository, by executing the following command as root: ::

  yum list | grep percona

You should see output similar to the following: ::

  percona-release.x86_64                     0.0-1                         @/percona-release-0.0-1.x86_64

  percona-xtrabackup.x86_64                  2.1.7-721.rhel6               percona


Supported Platforms
===================

  *  ``x86_64``
  *  ``i386``

Supported Releases
==================

The *CentOS* repositories should work well with *Red Hat Enterprise Linux* too, provided that :program:`yum` is installed on the server.

* *CentOS* 5 and *RHEL* 5

* *CentOS* 6 and *RHEL* 6 (Current Stable) [#f1]_ 

* *Amazon Linux AMI* (works the same as *CentOS* 5)

Percona `yum` Experimental repository
=====================================

Percona offers fresh beta builds from the experimental repository. To subscribe to the experimental repository, install the experimental *RPM*: ::

 yum install http://repo.percona.com/testing/centos/6/os/noarch/percona-testing-0.0-1.noarch.rpm

.. note:: 
 This repository works for both RHEL/CentOS 5 and RHEL/CentOS 6

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] Because there is no official CentOS way to support/get latest OpenSSL on CentOS versions prior to 6.5. Similarly, and also as a result thereof, we decided that there is no official Percona way to support latest |Percona Server| builds on CentOS versions prior to 6.5. Added to this is the fact that many would need to upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1g in any case (due to `Heartbleed <http://heartbleed.com>`_ vulnerabilty), and this is not available from any official repo for 6.4 and prior. For any officially unsupported system ``src.rpm`` packages may be used to rebuild |Percona Server| for any environment.
